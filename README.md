All datasets except CAIDA and ITU datasets used in the paper have been added to the repository under the folder "datasets". CAIDA dataset can be obtained from http://data.caida.org/datasets/topology/ark/ipv4/itdk/2019-04/. ITU land cables dataset is private and I don't have the permission to release it.

scripts/fig-n-*.sh has all the steps necessary to generate Fig n in the paper. The output plots are stored in the "outputs" folder and the intermediate data in the "processedData" folder.
